## General Areas of Interest

I'm typically interested in research projects in the following categories. If you've got an idea 
that falls into (or nearby) one of these areas and you'd like to work together, send me an e-mail.  
  + Case Studies and Research Promoting the *Social Good*
  + Data Science and Machine Learning
  + Simulation and Agent-Based Modeling
  + Mathematical Modeling
  + Graph Theory
  + Combinatorial Games

### Case Studies and the *Social Good*

I've authored several of the Undergraduate Research Case Studies for SNHU over the past three years. 
If you've looked at these case studies, you'll notice that the majority of them offer researchers an
opportunity to think about, and advocate for, making positive change around an important issue within 
their local, state, or larger communities. As citizens of an increasingly interconnected world, I 
believe it is important that we use our talents to improve the lives of everyone around us.

### Data Science and Machine Learning

Using data and writing code to help computers learn to solve, or provide insight into, non-trivial 
problems is truly empowering. I've mentored students using both R and Python to build models for 
either predictive or descriptive purposes in a variety of applications. Check out the [UCI Machine
Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
for interesting project ideas. Additionally, I encourage anyone interested in Data Science to follow
the [*TidyTuesday*](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) social data visualization project
and to participate using our SNHU Analytics Slack Channel (e-mail me for an invite) or using the
hashtag #TidyTuesday on Twitter.
