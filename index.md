<br/><br/>

Hello, and welcome to my webpage! I am an Associate Professor of Mathematics at Southern New Hampshire University. While I earned my PhD in *Mathematics* under [Dr. Nancy Eaton](http://www.math.uri.edu/~eaton/) at the University of Rhode Island in 2013, my teaching responsibilities and interests have transitioned to data science over the past five years. In particular, I am interested in data science projects that promote the *social good*. The pages on this site contain information about the courses I teach, my current interests/endeavors, and information for people (particularly students) who are interested in working with me. I hope you'll find something useful during your visit!<br/>

### Currently Teaching

+ [MAT 239 (Discrete Mathematics for Computing)](DiscreteForComputing.md)
+ [MAT 241 (Modern Statistics with Software)](StatsWithR.md)
+ [QSO 370/570 (Predictive Analytics)](PredictiveAnalytics.md)


### Course Information from Previous Semesters

You can find information about courses I've taught in previous semesters [here](OldCourses.md).

### Research With Undergraduates

Are you a current SNHU student who is interested in pursuing an undergraduate research project?I'm really interested in projects involving data science and machine learning, simulation and agent-based modeling, mathematical models, and anything involving graph theory or combinatiorial games. Check out [this page](UGRmentor.md) for more on my interests, recent projects with students, and how to contact me if you are interested in working together.

### Data Science and Machine Learning

I became interested in data science in 2016 and have (slowly) been transitioning my professional focus in this direction ever since. While I'm not much of a blogger, you'll eventually be able to check in on what I'm up to [here](MyDSjourney.md).

### Other Initiatives

In addition to teaching undergraduate and graduate students at Southern New Hampshire University, I have pursued various external projects.

  + I worked with [Reaching Higher New Hampshire](https://reachinghighernh.org/) as a data science consultant on a variety of projects related to the state of public education in New Hampshire as well as education funding in New Hampshire.
  + I am on the *Steering Committee* for the North Shore Undergraduate Mathematics Conference (link to be added), a regional conference dedicated to making mathematics accessible to any math undergraduates, with participants from throughout eastern Massachusetts and New Hampshire.
  + I have run several summer *Faculty Upskilling* workshops here at SNHU. These workshops are targeted at faculty from a variety of disciplines. The two I have run are:  

    +  Introductory and Intermediate Data Science / Machine Learning (2020) 
    +  [Foundations of Natural Language Processing](https://agmath.github.io/FacultyUpskilling/) (2021, with William Jamieson)

  + I am very passionate about high-quality open educational resources (OER). I have been working with [OpenIntro.org](https://www.openintro.org/) since 2015. 
 
    + I developed and maintain a course shell at [MyOpenMath](https://www.myopenmath.com/) which aligns with the OpenIntro Statistics (4Ed) textbook.
    + I developed and maintain a set of interactive notes for a course using the OpenIntro Statistics (4Ed) textbook and the R language. You can find those notebooks and installation instructions [here](https://github.com/agmath/AppliedStatsInteractive)
    + I have run several workshops for faculty at SNHU to discuss the advantages of adopting OER as well as where to find high-quality resources.
