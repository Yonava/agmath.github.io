## Welcome

Welcome to my webpage. I am an Associate Professor of Mathematics at Southern New Hampshire University. 
While I earned my PhD in Mathematics under [Dr. Nancy Eaton](http://www.math.uri.edu/~eaton/) at the 
University of Rhode Island in 2013, my teaching responsibilities and research interests have transitioned 
to data science. I hope that you'll find some of the materials posted here to be interesting and useful.
  
## Currently Teaching

+ MAT 225 (Calculus I)
+ MAT 241 (Modern Statistics with Software)
+ QSO 370 (Predictive Analytics)

## Course Information from Previous Semesters

You can find information about courses I've taught in previous semesters here (link to be added).

## Other Initiatives

In addition to teaching undergraduate and graduate students at Southern New Hampshire University, I have pursued various external projects.

  + I worked with Reaching Higher New Hampshire as a data science consultant on a variety of projects related to the state of public education in New Hampshire as well as education funding in New Hampshire.
  + I have run several summer workshops to help faculty across a wide range of disciplines at Southern New Hampshire University learn about data science, machine learning, and natural language processing.
  + I am very passionate about high-quality open educational resources (OER). I have been working with [OpenIntro.org](https://www.openintro.org/) since 2015. 
 
    + I developed and maintain a course shell at [MyOpenMath](https://www.myopenmath.com/) which aligns with the OpenIntro Statistics (4Ed) textbook.
    + I developed and maintain a set of interactive notes for a course using the OpenIntro Statistics (4Ed) textbook and the R language. You can find those notebooks and installation instructions [here](https://github.com/agmath/AppliedStatsInteractive)
    + I have run several workshops for faculty at SNHU to discuss the advantages of adopting OER as well as where to find high-quality resources.
