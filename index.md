Hello! Welcome to my webpage. I am an Associate Professor of Mathematics at Southern New Hampshire University. 
While I earned my PhD in Mathematics under [Dr. Nancy Eaton](http://www.math.uri.edu/~eaton/) at the 
University of Rhode Island in 2013, my teaching responsibilities and research interests have transitioned 
to data science. In particular, I am interested in data science that promote the *social good*. I hope 
that you'll find some of the materials posted here to be interesting and useful.
  
## Currently Teaching

+ [MAT 239 (Discrete Mathematics for Computing)](DiscreteForComputing.md)
+ [MAT 241 (Modern Statistics with Software)](StatsWithR.md)
+ [MAT 431 (Introduction to Discrete Mathematical Modeling)](DiscreteModeling.md)
+ [QSO 370/570 (Predictive Analytics)](PredictiveAnalytics.md)

### Course Information from Previous Semesters

You can find information about courses I've taught in previous semesters [here](OldCourses.md).

## Interested in Undergraduate Research?

Are you a current SNHU student who is interested in pursuing an undergraduate research project?
I'm really interested in projects involving data science and machine learning, simulation and
agent-based modeling, mathematical models, and anything involving graph theory or combinatiorial
games. Check out [this page](UGRmentor.md) for more on my interests, recent projects with students,
and how to contact me if you are interested in working together.

## Data Science and Machine Learning

I became interested in data science in 2016 and have (slowly) been transitioning my professional focus in 
this direction ever since. While I'm not much of a blogger, you can check in on what I'm up to 
[here](MyDSjourney.md).

## Other Initiatives

In addition to teaching undergraduate and graduate students at Southern New Hampshire University, I have pursued various external projects.

  + I worked with [Reaching Higher New Hampshire](https://reachinghighernh.org/) as a data science consultant on a variety of projects related to the state of public education in New Hampshire as well as education funding in New Hampshire.
  + I have run several summer workshops to help faculty across a wide range of disciplines at Southern New Hampshire University learn about data science, machine learning, and [natural language processing](https://agmath.github.io/FacultyUpskilling/).
  + I am very passionate about high-quality open educational resources (OER). I have been working with [OpenIntro.org](https://www.openintro.org/) since 2015. 
 
    + I developed and maintain a course shell at [MyOpenMath](https://www.myopenmath.com/) which aligns with the OpenIntro Statistics (4Ed) textbook.
    + I developed and maintain a set of interactive notes for a course using the OpenIntro Statistics (4Ed) textbook and the R language. You can find those notebooks and installation instructions [here](https://github.com/agmath/AppliedStatsInteractive)
    + I have run several workshops for faculty at SNHU to discuss the advantages of adopting OER as well as where to find high-quality resources.
