title: Predictive Analytics
description: This is a homepage for QSO370/570, Predictive Analytics, at Southern New Hampshire University. The course covers predictive modeling in both the regression and classification settings. Topics covered include linear and curvi-linear regression, tree-based models, logistic regression, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, model assessment, and more.

## QSO 370/570 - Predictive Analytics

<img src="/SiteFiles/PredictiveAnalytics.jpg" align="left" width=150>[**Syllabus (Fall 2021)**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KuyfmIcD5KhI0Qz8fYGSaPFTw67udnIl/view?usp=sharing)<br/>
<br/>
***Course Description:*** This course introduces the techniques of predictive modeling in a data-rich business en-
vironment in order to predict future business outcomes and associated risks. It covers multivariate and other
techniques to implement predictive models for a variety of practical business applications.<br/>
<br/>
*Students in this course should expect to use Python and Jupyter Notebooks (via Google Colab). Students will work
through scripted analyses outside of class meetings and then will get their hands dirty, working with real data
during class time. Applications will vary according to student and instructor interests.*<br/>

### Class Notes

**Jupyter Notebooks for Class:** The Jupyter Notebooks for this course can be accessed via my [Predictive Analytics GitHub Repo](https://github.com/agmath/PredictiveAnalytics). The preferred method for accessing, and interacting with, these notebooks is through Google Colab.  
+ Navigate to [colab.research.google.com](colab.research.google.com).
+ Click the button to *Add to Drive*, which will add Colab functionality to your Google Drive.
+ Create a folder for QSO 370/570 in your Google Drive and copy all of the Jupyter Notebooks from the GitHub Repository into it.
+ Double-click on the notebook you wish to open and then click on the orange CO logo at the top of the page to *open with Colab*.
+ You are now running a live Jupyter Notebook from within Google Drive -- you should treat these as your notes; feel free to edit them as you see fit.

These notebooks can also be interacted with via *binder* (see the link in the repository) or by downloading python via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and running everything locally. The binder solution is sub-optimal because no edits can be saved.

### Class Competition Assignments

In addition to traditional homework assignments in this course, students will encounter four assignments related to an In-Class Kaggle Competition. These assignments are designed to help with two things: getting practice in building and assessing predictive models, and practice with technical report-writing. The Kaggle Competition will be closed such that only students will be able to join, so students will be competing with their peers who are also learning about predictive modeling. The competition assignment for the Fall 2021 semester involves predicting hourly demand for a BikeShare service in the DC Metro area. A link to the competition will be posted in BrightSpace.
