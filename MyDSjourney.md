title: My Journey Into Data Science
description: As I learn new things, I'll try to share the corresponding R Markdown or Jupyter Notebooks here. Occassionally I'll post my thoughts about transitioning from pure mathematics into data science and machine learning. I'll also use this page to showcase some of my work.

#### Finding Data Science (posted: 8/19/2021)

For my first post to this page, I thought it would make sense to discuss how I found my way into Data Science. First, my path to data science was not the traditional one (if there is such a thing). All of my formal background is in pure mathematics -- the kind of mathematics where you make conjectures about objects/structures and hope to either prove or disprove them. This type of mathematics can certainly find applications in the *real world*, but that's not typically the focus of a pure mathematician.

After graduating with my PhD in 2013, I entered academia and began teaching mathematics at the undergraduate level. One semester, I was asked to teach an introductory applied statistics course and was told that I should plan to teach the students how to do statistics with functionality on the TI calculators. Honestly, I couldn't believe this -- who on Earth does statistics and data analysis with a hand-held, graphing calcuator? It should be no-one. I certainly wasn't going to be responsible for students going out into the world thinking that this was state of the art, or even status quo, for data analysis. Unfortunately, the fact that a TI calculator was not an appropriate data analysis tool was nearly the extent of what I knew. I called some friends who I knew worked with data in their industry jobs and asked them what they used for tools.

I was surprised that MatLab, Minitab, SPSS, etc. were not the answers I got from these people. No, Excel wasn't their response either. Over and over, I heard R or Python (and some SQL too). At this point, I began swearing at my 18-year-old self who decided that Computer Science, and programming in general, was not for him. Oh what a better position I would have been in had I taken more than just one basic course in C++ twelve years prior. There's no use dwelling on that now, but if you find yourself in a position in which you like mathematics and statistics, please take some programming courses -- you'll be reall well served.

It was 2016 when I first rewrote my statistics and regression analysis classes to make use of R. At that point, I remember being terrified that my students would ask coding questions or run into errors that I had no idea how to troubleshoot. Despite my fears, these things happened, class periods were derailed while we searched for solutions or engaged in troubleshooting, we survived, and all involved (students and myself) came out better for it on the other side.

There are several reasons for which I'm really glad I took that plunge. My courses are infinitely better (more effective, more engaging, more relevant, more fun) than they would be if I wasn't using industry-standard software. My students admit that the use of software and interactive code has allowed them to see the true importantce of the assumptions made by statistical procedures, rather than seeing assumptions as just a random checklist of items that are *important for some reason*. My students are much more prepared to engage in meaningful data analysis beyond the classroom setting. Lastly, I've found much more satisfaction in my own work and classes -- I love using code to extract meaningful insights from piles of raw data. 

Since 2016, I've spent as much time as I can learning about data science and machine learning. I've found something that I'm truly passionate about and I'm always looking to advance my skills. I'll save discussions about my learning for another post. -- AG
